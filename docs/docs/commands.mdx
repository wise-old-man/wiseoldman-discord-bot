# Commands

You can call our bot's commands by typing `/` on Discord's chat box and browse our available commands. These are what Discord calls Application Commands (or Slash Commands) and they should not require the bot to be in the channel you're currently on.

<br />

---

## General commands

<br />

### /help

By default (without specifying any categories), this command will provide you with a few useful links, and a detailed list of your configurations, including your currently tracked group and your notification configurations.

#### Example (default)

<CommandCall commandRoot="/help" />

<br />

![Help Command (default)](./assets/help.png)

Alternatively, you can choose to select a category to get specific info on that topic. The current categories are:

- RuneLite
- Plugin
- Sync
- Verified
- Permissions
- FAQ
- Flag

#### Example (flag category):

<CommandCall commandRoot="/help" options={[{ key: 'category', value: 'Flag' }]} />

<br />

![Help Command (flag)](./assets/help_flag.png)

## Config commands

<br />

### /config group

<Badge>Requires Admin Permissions</Badge>
<br />
<br />

To use any group-specific commands, or receive group-related [notifications](/notifications), the bot needs to know what group your server is interested in.

This command allows you to specify a group ID, and the bot will use that ID for any future group-related commands or notifications.

:::info
If you don't know your group's ID, it should be the number in your group's wiseoldman.net page URL.

![Group ID URL](./assets/group_id.png)
:::

<br />

#### Example

<CommandCall commandRoot="/config group" options={[{ key: 'group_id', value: '139' }]} />

<br />

![Config Group Command](./assets/config_group.png)

<br />

---

### /config notifications

<Badge>Requires Admin Permissions</Badge>
<br />
<br />

Besides commands, this bot can also send [notifications](/notifications) to your Discord server when something happens to one of your group members (new achievements, HCIM death, etc), or to your competitions (started, ended, starting soon, etc).

For this, the bot needs to know where to send those notifications, and since there are many types of notifications, you need to either specify where to receive each type, disable a type, or just **assign a default notifications channel**.

The current notification types are:

- Default
- Competition Status
- Member Achievements
- Member Name Changed
- Member (HCIM) Died
- Members List Changed

:::info
The bot will check for permissions (by sending a message and immediately deleting it) in the selected channel before accepting this configuration, if you choose to remove permissions after configuration, it will simply stop working.
:::

<br />

#### Example (default channel)

<CommandCall
  commandRoot="/config notifications"
  options={[
    { key: 'notification_type', value: 'Default' },
    { key: 'notification_channel', value: '#general' }
  ]}
/>

<br />

![Config Notifications Command (default)](./assets/config_notifications_default.png)

    { key: 'notification_type', value: 'Members List Changed' },
    { key: 'notification_channel', value: '#bot-channel' }
  ]}
/>
